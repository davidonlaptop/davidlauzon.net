I am David Lauzon, a freelance web developer since February 2005. I am usually based in Montreal (QC, Canada), but I will be blogging from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Chang+Moi,+Thailand&sll=18.798581,98.991451&sspn=0.03697,0.063257&ie=UTF8&cd=2&geocode=0,18.795565,98.998720&ll=18.798418,98.997717&spn=0.03697,0.063257&z=14&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Chiang Mai</a> (Thailand) for the following months.

I will be writing about Ruby on Rails, Web 2.0, Linux, and general IT developments. I also will be releasing open source code here, so stay tuned !
